# Minesweeper
 
This is my first front-end project, an attempt on the classic Minesweeper. Left click to reveal, and middle-mouse button to rotate between flagged, questioned, and normal hidden modes. Being connected to the internet is a bonus, as the font for the 'Minesweeper!' title comes from google fonts. Have fun!
